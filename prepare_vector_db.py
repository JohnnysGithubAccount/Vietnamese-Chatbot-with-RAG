        Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. 
        By using algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions, machine learning can automate complex tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. 
        This technology is widely used in various industries, from healthcare for diagnosing diseases to finance for detecting fraudulent transactions. 
        As machine learning models are exposed to more data, they become more accurate and efficient, making them invaluable tools for solving real-world problems12.
