# Vietnamese Q&A Chatbot with RAG
<<<<<<< HEAD

## Overview

This project implements a Vietnamese Question and Answer (Q&A) chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). 
The chatbot leverages both a retrieval mechanism to fetch relevant context and a generative model to produce coherent and contextually appropriate responses. This approach allows for more accurate and informative answers to user queries in Vietnamese.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Understands and processes queries in Vietnamese.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Combines retrieval techniques with generative models for enhanced accuracy.
- **Multi-turn Conversations**: Capable of maintaining context across multiple interactions.
- **Customizable Knowledge Base**: Easily update the knowledge base with new information.
